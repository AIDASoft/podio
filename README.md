## Prerequisites

If you are on lxplus, all the necessary software is preinstalled if you
use a recent LCG or FCC stack release.

On Mac OS or Ubuntu, you need to install the following software.

### ROOT 6.08.06

Install ROOT 6.08.06 (or later) and set up your ROOT environment:

    source <root_path>/bin/thisroot.sh

### Python 2.7

Check the python version by doing:

    python --version

Check that the yaml python module is available

    python
    >>> import yaml

If the import goes fine (no message), you're all set. If not, you need to install yaml. For that, you need to:

1- install the C++ yaml library, which is used by the python module. On Mac OS, The easiest way to do that is to use homebrew (install homebrew if you don't have it yet):

    brew install libyaml

2- install the python yaml module (first install pip if you don't have it yet)

    pip install pyyaml

Check that you can now import the yaml module in python.


## Preparing the environment

Full use of PODIO requires you to set the `PODIO` environment variable
and modify `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH`. Some convenience scripts
are provided:

    # Set PODIO install area to `./install` and setup environment accordingly
    source ./init.sh

or

    # Setup environment based on current value of `PODIO`
    source ./env.sh

Or you can setup the environment entirely under your control: see `init.sh`
and `env.sh`.

## Compiling

If you are using the easy setup from `init.sh` then create separate build
and install areas, and trigger the build:

    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
    make -j 4 install

To see a list of options, do this in the build-directory:

    cmake -LH ..

## Running

The examples are for creating a file "example.root",

    ../install/tests/write

reading it again in C++,

    ../install/tests/read

and reading it again in python,

    python ../tests/read.py

## Modifying the data model

Podio features an example event data model, fully described in the yaml file
[tests/datalayout.yaml](tests/datalayout.yaml).
The C++ in [tests/datamodel/](tests/datamodel/) has been fully generated by a code generation script, [python/podio_class_generator.py](python/podio_class_generator.py).

To run the code generation script, do

    mkdir ../Tmp
    mkdir ../Tmp/data
    mkdir ../Tmp/src
    python ../python/podio_class_generator.py ../examples/datalayout.yaml ../Tmp data

The generation script has the following additional options:

- `--clangformat` (`-c`): Apply clang-format after file creation (uses [option `-style=file`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) with llvm as backup style), needs clang-format in `$PATH`.
- `--quiet` (`-q`): Suppress all print out to STDOUT
- `--dryrun` (`-d`): Only run the generation logic and validate yaml, do not write files to disk

## Running tests
After compilation and installation (!) you can run rudimentary tests with

    make test
