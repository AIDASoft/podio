# v00-16-02

* 2022-12-19 Thomas Madlener ([PR#360](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/360))
  - Make the log output of loading the SIOBlock libraries more informative by also providing the absolute paths to the loaded (and rejected) shared libraries.

* 2022-12-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#333](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/333))
  - Initialize the `unique_ptr<mutex>` in the constructor initializer list instead of in the member variable declaration. This is more likely a bug in nvcc (or maybe a c++17 feature not yet supported by nvcc). Fixes key4hep/k4Clue#34
  - Pass `--disable-new-dtags` to the linker when using `PODIO_SET_RPATH`, to set `RPATH` and not `RUNPATH` in the binaries.
  - Pin the ubuntu version for runners that build on ubuntu to not accidentally go out of sync with the underlying LCG releases.
  - Disable the podio tests in the edm4hep workflows (see #359).

  - Use the functionality in argparse to choose between options

* 2022-12-06 Benedikt Hegner ([PR#346](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/346))
  - Switched tp Apache 2.0 license to facilitate integration in experiment stacks.

* 2022-12-05 Thomas Madlener ([PR#357](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/357))
  - Put `<prefix>/bin` onto `PATH` in order to make `podio-dump` available from environments created with `env.sh`

* 2022-12-02 jmcarcell ([PR#354](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/354))
  - Make `env.sh` setup script POSIX compliant to run in shells other than bash
    - Change `==` to `=`
    - Change tabs to spaces (two) to avoid mix of spaces and tabs for indenting
    - Add `<prefix>/include` to `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` (as it is required since #343)

* 2022-11-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#351](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/351))
  -  Fix bug in Frame python bindings where empty collections were considered as non-existing. Replacing the original check relying on some implicit boolean conversions (which also caught empty collections) to an explicit check against `nullptr`.
  - Make `podio-dump` more robust in installations without SIO support, by guarding the corresponding import.

* 2022-11-14 Thomas Madlener ([PR#344](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/344))
  - Make `podio-dump` work with new Frame based I/O (fixes #339)
  - Keep existing functionality intact by using the legacy readers introduced in #345.

* 2022-11-11 Thomas Madlener ([PR#345](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/345))
  - Add a `ROOTLegacyReader` and a `SIOLegacyReader` that read files that have been written prior to #287 into `podio::Frame`s and offers the same interface as the frame readers
    - Also including python bindings for it

* 2022-11-10 Thomas Madlener ([PR#349](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/349))
  - Fix bug in setting relations in nested get calls in `podio::Frame`. Fixes #348 
  - Adapt the read test to actually check this. Previously this went unnoticed, because the necessary relations were already set in a previous call.

* 2022-11-10 Thomas Madlener ([PR#343](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/343))
  - Add python bindings for `Frame` based I/O
    - Available from `podio.root_io` and `podio.sio_io`, where a `Reader` and a `Writer` is implemented for each.
    - Wrapper around `podio::Frame`. **Requires that the `podio/Frame.h` header is available somewhere on the `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH`**.
  - Add necessary functionality for python bindings to C++ API
    - untyped `Frame::get` method for getting collections
    - New constructor from `FrameDataT&&`
    - functionality to inspect file and `Frame` contents more easily
  - Reorganize python code into structure that follows the usual python packaging conventions a bit more closely
    - Introduce the `podio` module. Make CMake generate the `__init__.py` with the correct version
    - Move everything except the generator script into `module`. Additionally also keep an `EventStore` wrapper to not break existing code. 
  - Refactor the `CMakeLists.txt` that is responsible for building the core and all required I/O libraries
    - Build more dictionaries for more python bindings.

* 2022-11-02 Thomas Madlener ([PR#342](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/342))
  - Migrate to `actions/checkout@v3` as advised by [github](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-09-22-github-actions-all-actions-will-begin-running-on-node16-instead-of-node12/)
  - Use the checkout action to clone the dependencies in the edm4hep workflow instead of doing an explicit clone in the body of the action

* 2022-11-02 Dmitry Kalinkin ([PR#327](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/327))

* 2022-10-24 Juraj Smiesko ([PR#340](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/340))
  - Adding reading of specific entry from frame

* 2022-10-21 Thomas Madlener ([PR#335](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/335))
  - Update the `github-action-cvmfs` and `run-lcg-view` actions to their latest available version to pick up the latest improvements (caching of dependencies, log groups)
  - Introduce log groups in github actions for easier to interpret outputs
  - Switch to LCG_102 for lcg based build environments
  - Add a workflow that builds and tests EDM4hep after building podio

# v00-16

* 2022-10-04 Thomas Madlener ([PR#337](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/337))
  - Make the notebook pattern functionality return `std::vector`s instead of `std::array` to avoid having to specify a static size. Fixes #332 
  - **Backwards incompatible change** as the return type as well as the call signature for the notebook pattern change.

* 2022-09-27 Andre Sailer ([PR#336](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/336))
  - podioConfig.cmake: silence warning about cmake policy CMP00012
  - CMake: explicitly look for catch2 version 3 and fail at cmake instead of compile step

* 2022-09-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#334](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/334))
  - Fix a warning/error message from ROOT from attempts to stream the `std::mutex` members of `GenericParameters` by marking them as transient for the dictionary generation.

* 2022-09-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#323](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/323))
  - Add a `podio-dump` python script (installed to `<prefix>/bin` that can be used to dump event contents to stdout. By default prints an overview over the collections and their types, but can also be used to dump full events, via the `-d` or `--detailed` flag. Use `--help` to get all available options and their descriptions.
  - To allow `podio-dump` to work with all available backends also add support for reading SIO via the `PythonEventStore`.
    - Split off the necessary c++ functionality into a separate `podioPythonStore` library (+ necessary ROOT dictionaries).
  - Add a `print` function to the collections for easier dumping from the python side.
  - Add a `print` function to the `GenericParameters`
  - Make `goToEvent` is a part of the `IReader` interface and correctly implemented it for the `SIOReader`.

* 2022-09-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#287](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/287))
  - Introduce the `podio::Frame` as a generalized, thread-safe (event) data container.
    - This first version offers all necessary functionality and an almost finalized interface, i.e. we plan to keep this as stable as possible, but we might still change things if it turns out that there are better ways to do some things
    - For details about the basic interface and the underlying design considerations please consult the corresponding [documentation](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/doc/frame.md)
  - **This will be the only way to work with podio data starting from version 1.0**
    - For now the current I/O implementations remain in place unchanged, but they will be deprecated (and removed) in the not too distant future

# v00-15

* 2022-08-09 Thomas Madlener ([PR#312](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/312))
  - Add support for converting objects and collections to JSON using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
    - To enable JSON support it is necessary to build the datamodel with `PODIO_JSON_OUTPUT` and to link against the nlohmann/json library.

* 2022-08-05 Wouter Deconinck ([PR#318](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/318))
  - CMake: PODIO_ADD_ROOT_IO_DICT: Bugfix for data models in `OUTPUT_FOLDER` not equal to source dir in root dictionary generation cmake macro. 
    - Now `SELECTION_XML` can be passed either as absolute path or relative to `OUTPUT_FOLDER`.

* 2022-08-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#317](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/317))
  - Make it possible to pass an upstream datamodel to the class generator such that datatypes and components defined there can be used in an unrelated datamodel. This makes it possible to extend datamodels and to prototype new datatypes with the aim of upstreaming them eventually without having to redefine all the necessary components.
  - Refactor the internals of the config reader / class generator slightly to make it possible to hold multiple datamodels in memory

* 2022-08-02 Thomas Madlener ([PR#316](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/316))
  - Remove macOS CI workflows because github hosted runners will deprecate macOS 10.15 ([announcement](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/5583)) and later versions of macOS no longer support fuse and as a consequence CVMFS.

* 2022-07-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#315](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/315))
  - Make the `is_trivial_type` flag available in the template engine behave as expected (it behaved exactly oppositely to what was documented and what one would intuitively expect). The flag was originally introduced in #288

* 2022-07-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#283](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/283))
  - Allow users to define default values for member variables, instead of default initializing all of them.
    - The syntax for specifying a default value is `- <type> <name>{<init-value>} // <description>`.
    - The passed value is not validated in any way. **Apart from a very basic syntax check, there is no validation that the provided default initialization values are actually valid**. This means that generated code might not compile.
  - Remove some of the python2 compatibility and do some cleanup

* 2022-07-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#276](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/276))
  - Remove support for having std::string members in datatypes and components, as they break PODness and it seems that this feature was not in use in any case.
  - Make ROOTReader slightly more robust against missing datatypes in dictionaries when reading files.

* 2022-06-22 Valentin Volkl ([PR#307](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/307))
  - hotfix for https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/issues/290: revert a clang-tidy change to make sure that there are no unknown symbols in podioDict

* 2022-06-21 Thomas Madlener ([PR#282](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/282))
  - Add a `PODIO_USE_CLANG_FORMAT` option to the cmake configuration to toggle the autodiscovery of `clang-format` and a `.clang-format` configuration file. This option is also available for downstream packages that use podio to generate their EDM. 
    - The default is `AUTO`, where we try to discover a suitable `clang-format` version as well as a `.clang-format` file and use it if we find it.
    - If set to `OFF` podio will not try to see whether `clang-format` and a `.clang-format` file are available and will also not try to format the code accordingly.
    - If set to `ON` podio will actually require a suitable `clang-format` version and the presence of a `.clang-format` file and will fail at the cmake stage if not present.

* 2022-06-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#305](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/305))
  - Make sure generator warnings are printed
  - Add a deprecation warning for the upcoming removal of support of `std::string` in data types. (See also #276)

* 2022-06-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#294](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/294))
  - Remove the `EventStore`, `CollectionIDTable` and `version::Version` members from the `SIOCollectionIDTableBlock` to make it easier to use in the `Frame` context
  - Move the `podio:version::build_version` into its own `SIOVersionBlock`
  - **This is a breaking change for the SIO backend and it will not be able to read files that have been written prior to this**

# v00-14-02

  - Add instructions on how to run pre-commit locally to the documentation

* 2022-06-14 Thomas Madlener ([PR#295](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/295))
  - Mark `CollectionBase::prepareForWrite` as `const` and make sure that the generated implementations are thread safe.

* 2022-06-14 Thomas Madlener ([PR#286](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/286))
  - Make sure that vector member buffers for writing point to the correct place even if a collection has been moved, by resetting them when the buffers are requested.
  - Add checks for this to the unittests, as this is sort of an interface for I/O backends.

* 2022-06-13 Kalina Stoimenova ([PR#301](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/301))
  - Fixed the text in the cmake message for code generation to point to the correct readme file

* 2022-06-13 Thomas Madlener ([PR#300](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/300))
  - Newer versions of pylint have removed a few options and a few checks that aimed at python2-python3 compatibility.

* 2022-06-13 Thomas Madlener ([PR#299](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/299))
  - Explicitly add constructors to `CollectionBase`
  - Make sure to not use an unset `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for detecting sio blocks shared libraries.

* 2022-05-30 soumil ([PR#291](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/291))
  - Replace the `obj_needs_destructor` flag in the generator code and templates with the `is_trivial_type` flag, since that is the more appropriate name. (Fixes #288)

* 2022-05-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#274](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/274))
  - Add documentation for the Jinja2 templates and the code generation process in general to make working with these parts of PODIO easier.

* 2022-05-23 Thomas Madlener ([PR#262](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/262))
  - Make the getters and setters for the `GenericParameters` templated functions and add a deprecation warning for the untemplated ones.
  - Define a `SupportedGenericDataTypes` tuple defining the types (and vectors of those) that can be stored in `GenericParameters`
  - Add a `podio/utilities/TypeHelpers.h` header with some type handling helpers.

* 2022-05-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#277](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/277))
  - Avoid fetching the (remote) legacy input file for tests unnecessarily every time cmake is run.

* 2022-05-17 Thomas Madlener ([PR#284](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/284))
  - Make sure the `EventStore` doesn't try to read event meta data multiple times per event
  - Add a `empty` method to `GenericParameters` to check if any parameters are stored.

* 2022-04-04 Thomas Madlener ([PR#280](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/280))
  - Only use `--color` option for diff in `clang-format` wrapper script if it is supported by the underlying `diffutils`.

* 2022-04-02 Thomas Madlener ([PR#254](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/254))
  - Add a `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` config file for consistent formatting and following a few coding guidelines.
  - Add pre-commit hooks that run `clang-tidy` and `clang-format` 
  - Make all currently present files follow the formatting and guidelines of the present configuration.
  - Make the `PODIO_GENERATE_DATAMODEL` macro look for a `.clang-format` file and the presence of `clang-format`and automatically format all the generated files if both are there.

* 2022-04-01 Thomas Madlener ([PR#279](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/279))
  - Fix test environment to work again in newest Key4hep release by unsetting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` in the test environment to avoid potential clashes with existing other installations in the environment.
  - Add CI build against the Key4hep nightlies.
  - Switch to use the Catch2 installation from Key4hep for the workflows.

* 2022-03-31 Thomas Madlener ([PR#253](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/253))
  - Add a basic setup for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and replace the python linting github workflow with one that is run via pre-commit.
    - Add additional checks for consistent line-endings and removal of trailing whitespaces.
  - Update pylint and flake8 config to no longer check for python2/python3 compatibility but instead follow the same guidelines as e.g. in ILCDirac.
  - Fix all issues that were uncovered.

* 2022-03-23 Thomas Madlener ([PR#270](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/270))
  - Remove duplicated printing of component members in the `std::ostream& operator<<` overloads of the datatypes. Fixes #269 
  - Add an example datatype that broke compilation before these fixes.

* 2022-03-18 Andre Sailer ([PR#265](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/265))

  - Filter files with regex based on file name, not complete path

* 2022-02-08 Thomas Madlener ([PR#238](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/238))
  - Extend the `podioVersion.h` header that is configured by cmake to hold some version utilities.
    - `podio::version::Version` class holding three `uint16_t`s for major, minor and patch version, plus `constexpr` comparison operators.
    - static const(expr) `podio::version::build_version` that holds the current (i.e. last tag) version of podio
    - Add preprocessor macros with similar functionality
      - `PODIO_VERSION` takes a major, minor and a patch version number and encodes it into a 64 bit version constant. 
      - `PODIO_[MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH]_VERSION` macros can extracts these values again from a 64 bit encoded version. 
      - `PODIO_BUILD_VERSION` holds the 64 bit encoded current (i.e. last tag) version of podio
  - Reorder the read tests slightly and make some sections version dependent
  - Add legacy file read test from #230

* 2022-01-28 Thomas Madlener ([PR#256](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/256))
  - Ignore the test introduced in #235 in sanitizer builds as it currently breaks.

* 2022-01-24 Placido Fernandez Declara ([PR#235](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/235))
  - Fix crashes that happen when reading collections that have related objects in collections that have not been persisted.
  - Fix similar crashes for subset collections where the original collection has not been persisted.
    - The expected behavior in both cases is that podio does not crash when reading such collections, but only once the user tries to actually access such a missing object. Each object has an `isAvailable` function to guard against such crashes if need be.
  - Add a test that makes sure that the expected behavior is the one that is observed.
  - Fix a somewhat related bug in `setReferences` which was mistakenly a no-op for collections of a type without relations. Since this is the mechanism we use for restoring subset collections it obviously has to be present for all types.

* 2022-01-21 Thomas Madlener ([PR#252](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/252))
  - Make the `CollectionData` classes use `unique_ptr` instead of raw pointers, wherever they actually own the pointer.
  - Implement move constructors and move assignment operators for collections. Thanks to the usage of `unique_ptr` for ownership management in the `CollectionData`, these can be `default`ed in `Collection` and `CollectionData`.
  - Add a few tests to check that moving collections actually works.

* 2022-01-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#251](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/251))
  - Make sure that collections of types without relations can still be used properly as subset collections. Previous to these changes, the necessary functionality was not generated if a datatype had no relations (i.e. not a single `OneToOneRelation` or `OneToManyRelation`).
  - Add a check of this functionality to the write/read tests.

* 2022-01-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#249](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/249))
  - Add a `USE_SANITIZER` build option to more easily build podio with sanitizers for testing. Curently `Address`, `Memory[WithOrigin]`, `Undefined` and `Thread` are available as options. Given the limitations of the sanitizers these are more or less mutually exlusive.
  - Label all the Catch2 test cases which makes it easier to run them selectively.
  - For builds with sanitizers enabled, by default ignore tests with known failures, but add a `FORCE_RUN_ALL_TESTS` cmake option that overrides this for local development.
  - Run CI workflows with a selection of sanitizers enabled (on a limited list of tests).

* 2022-01-20 hegner ([PR#209](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/209))
  - Remove mention of Python 2 compatibility

* 2021-12-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#245](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/245))
  - Make it possible to call `prepareForWrite` multiple times on collections by rendering all but the first call no-ops. Fixes #241
    - Collections are marked as prepared, either if they are read from file or once `prepareForWrite` has been called on them.

* 2021-12-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#205](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/205))
  - Make the default classes immutable and mark mutable classes explictly via their class name (e.g. `Hit` and `MutableHit`). See a brief discussion in #204 for more details on the reasons for this **breaking change**.
  - After these changes collections return mutable objects via their `create` functionality, and will only give access to the default (immutable) objects when they are `const` (e.g. when they are read from file).
  - In general these changes should make it easier for users to write interface that behave as expected, and also make it very obvious where objects are actually mutated already from looking at an interface definition.

* 2021-10-22 Thomas Madlener ([PR#239](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/239))

  - Make the `CollectionData` classes use `unique_ptr` instead of raw pointers, wherever they actually own the pointer.
  - Implement move constructors and move assignment operators for collections. Thanks to the usage of `unique_ptr` for ownership management in the `CollectionData`, these can be `default`ed in `Collection` and `CollectionData`.
  - Add a few tests to check that moving collections actually works.

* 2022-01-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#251](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/251))
  - Make sure that collections of types without relations can still be used properly as subset collections. Previous to these changes, the necessary functionality was not generated if a datatype had no relations (i.e. not a single `OneToOneRelation` or `OneToManyRelation`).
  - Add a check of this functionality to the write/read tests.

* 2022-01-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#249](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/249))
  - Add a `USE_SANITIZER` build option to more easily build podio with sanitizers for testing. Curently `Address`, `Memory[WithOrigin]`, `Undefined` and `Thread` are available as options. Given the limitations of the sanitizers these are more or less mutually exlusive.
  - Label all the Catch2 test cases which makes it easier to run them selectively.
  - For builds with sanitizers enabled, by default ignore tests with known failures, but add a `FORCE_RUN_ALL_TESTS` cmake option that overrides this for local development.
  - Run CI workflows with a selection of sanitizers enabled (on a limited list of tests).

  - Make it possible to call `prepareForWrite` multiple times on collections by rendering all but the first call no-ops. Fixes #241
    - Collections are marked as prepared, either if they are read from file or once `prepareForWrite` has been called on them.

* 2021-12-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#205](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/205))
  - Make the default classes immutable and mark mutable classes explictly via their class name (e.g. `Hit` and `MutableHit`). See a brief discussion in #204 for more details on the reasons for this **breaking change**.
  - After these changes collections return mutable objects via their `create` functionality, and will only give access to the default (immutable) objects when they are `const` (e.g. when they are read from file).
  - In general these changes should make it easier for users to write interface that behave as expected, and also make it very obvious where objects are actually mutated already from looking at an interface definition.

  - add possibility to store additional user data as collections of fundamental types in PODIO files
       -  uses `std::vector<basic_type>`
       - stored in simple branch in root (and simple block in SIO)
       - all fundamental types supported in PODIO (except bool) can be written
  - example code:
  ```c++
    auto& usrInts = store.create<podio::UserDataCollection<uint64_t> >("userInts");
    auto& usrDoubles = store.create<podio::UserDataCollection<double> >("userDoubles");
    // ...
  
    // add some unsigned ints
    usrInts.resize( i + 1 ) ;
    int myInt = 0 ;
    for( auto& iu : usrInts ){
      iu = myInt++  ;
    }
    // and some user double values
    unsigned nd = 100 ;
    usrDoubles.resize( nd ) ;
    for(unsigned id=0 ; id<nd ; ++id){
      usrDoubles[id] = 42. ;
    }
  ```

  - Generate an additional `podio_generated_files.cmake` file containing all generated source files as a `header` and `sources` list and make the code generation macro include this file to get the headers and source files.
    - Now only the files generated for the current settings are picked up by cmake

  - Fix a few small issues in the datamodel yaml file validation. **These do not change the behavior of code generation, they just try to catch problems earlier**
    - Make sure that `OneToManyRelations` and `OneToOneRelations` have the same restrictions
    - Only allow `components`, builtins and arrays of those as `Members`
  - Make the API of `validate` slightly more generic by taking a dict instead of multiple arguments.
  - Make the generator exit with an easier to read error message in case of a validation problem instead of printing a full backtrace.

* 2021-08-18 Thomas Madlener ([PR#197](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/197))
  - Introduce a `podio::CollectionBuffers` class that contains everything that is necessary for I/O of a given collection. **This is a breaking change in the collection interface** 
  - Introduce  and generate a `CollectionData` class for each datatype that only manages the storage of a given collection.
    - Exposes only the `Obj` entries of each collection as well as the necessary functionality to add a new object (and its relations) to the collection.
  - Implement "subset" collections that behave exactly the same as normal collections apart from an additional function call when creating them.

* 2021-08-13 Thomas Madlener ([PR#206](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/206))
  - Switch to Catch2 v3 test library and by default assume that it is available. Use the 'USE_EXTERNAL_CATCH2` cmake option to control whether podio should use an external installation or if it should fetch and build it internally instead.

  - Add support for [fixed width integer type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer) members in components and datatypes.
    - Now possible to use `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` as members. Other fixed width integer types that are potentially defined in `<cstdint>` are not considered valid as the intended use case is really only fixed width integers for now. These are rejected at the datamodel validation step.
    - Fixed width integers are considered to be "builtin" types for podio.

  - Add some benchmarking tools, including `TimedReader` and `TimedWriter` decorators that allow to wrap (interface conforming) readers and writers and record the times different operations take. The times are recorded on two levels: setup times, like constructing a reader or "one-time" calls and per event times, for things that happen each event (e.g. `writeEvent` or `readCollection`). Additionally the `BenchmarkRecorder` in principle also allows to track additional things outside of these decorators.

* 2020-11-10 Thomas Madlener ([PR#130](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/130))
  - Add SIO as a second I/O backend (as alternative to ROOT) that can be enabled with `ENABLE_SIO`. If enabled, a separate `podioSioIO` library is built that allows reading and writing sio files. For serializing the different datatypes, additional code is generated to build an `SioBlocks` library that is loaded at runtime (if found somewhere on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). To facilitate the whole process at the cmake level, **new cmake functions** are provided to generate the core datamodel library **`PODIO_ADD_DATAMODEL_CORE_LIBRARY`**, to (conditionally) define the ROOT dictionary target **`PODIO_ADD_ROOT_IO_DICT`** and to (conditionally) define the Sio Blocks library target **`PODIO_ADD_SIO_IO_BLOCKS`**. The I/O backends that are supported by podio are exported via the **`PODIO_IO_HANDLERS`** list variable.
  - `podio_generate_datamodel.py` now additionally takes the I/O handlers that should be generated as arguments. This is also reflected in an additional argument to `PODIO_GENERATE_DATAMODEL`. To have backwards compatibility, this additional argument defaults to ROOT in both cases and downstream packages should work as usual without changes.

* 2020-08-11 tmadlener ([PR#120](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/120))
  - Use `jinja2` template engine to generate c++ code. This makes it possible to more cleanly separate the generation of the c++ code and all the necessary pre-processing. Now only the pre-processing is done in python, while the complete generation is done using `jinja2`. This should make it much easier to make changes to the generated c++ code.

* 2020-08-05 tmadlener ([PR#117](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/117))
  - Refactoring of the podio class generator to improve its readability. This refactoring is mainly focusing on reducing the size of some methods to make them easier to grasp as well as trying to more cleanly separate the validation of the inputs and the c++ code generation.  **The validation is stricter than the current version and will potentially break things. Specifically, the handling of `ExtraCode` and `ConstExtraCode` is now implemented according to the documentation.** In the previous version this has somewhat diverged from there. **The yaml declaration of `components` has been made equivalent to the ones of the `datatypes` but "old-style" definitions are still handled properly.** In the latter case a deprecation warning is emitted. **The generated c++ code is functionally equivalent, but not equal character by character.** The differences are mainly whitespace, but at some places also some of the generated code has been updated to more recent c++ capabilities. Additionally, some tests for the validation are added. They are not really exhaustive and should be considered to serve mainly documenting purposes for the moment.

  ```
  - example for reading:
