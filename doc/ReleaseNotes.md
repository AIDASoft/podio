# v00-99

* 2024-02-06 tmadlener ([PR#554](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/554))
  - Bring back `vector<Data>` and `vector<Component>` into the dictionaries to allow for better interoperability with RNTuple. 
    - See [#464](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/issues/464) for some related discussion.

* 2024-02-06 tmadlener ([PR#552](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/552))
  - Introduce an `operator<` to the interface types to make it possible to use them in STL containers that require that (e.g. `std::map` and `std::set`).

* 2024-02-06 tmadlener ([PR#549](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/549))
  - Rename `{ROOT,SIO}Frame{Reader,Writer}` to `{ROOT,SIO}{Reader,Writer}` since these names are now no longer taken by the deprecated `EventStore` based ones and Frame based I/O is the default now.
    - Keep the old names around as deprecated aliases to not break everything immediately. But **plan to remove the aliases for v1.0**.

* 2024-02-02 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#550](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/550))
  - Fixed typos in tests and interface template

* 2024-01-30 tmadlener ([PR#548](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/548))
  - Remove an unnecessary usage of the `TClass` machinery inside the `RNTupleReader` as all the necessary information is also available from metadata that we carry around in any case.

* 2024-01-30 Graeme A Stewart ([PR#544](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/544))
  Add CMake targets for running  black and flake8 on Python source files

  - Change ROOTNTuple{Reader,Writer} to RNTuple{Reader,Writer}

* 2024-01-22 tmadlener ([PR#516](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/516))
  - Add a new category of types that can be generated by podio: `interfaces`. These can be used to provide a type that can be initialized from several other datatypes and offers some common functionality. These interface types can be used in `OneToOneRelation`s and in `OneToManyRelation`s.
    - `interfaces` need to provide a list of types which they interface. Other types cannot be used with them.

* 2024-01-18 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#542](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/542))
  - Fixed typos in documentation and comments, updated .gitignore

* 2024-01-18 jmcarcell ([PR#540](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/540))
  - Add a check for the C++ standard using `ROOT_CXX_STANDARD` that was introduced yesterday in ROOT (https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/d487a42b311c5d0c7544031e3071a388c488c429)

* 2024-01-16 jmcarcell ([PR#539](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/539))
  - Fix crash when a writer is in the global namespace by adding a class that will manage all the writers and finish them before exiting

* 2024-01-16 jmcarcell ([PR#538](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/538))
  - Use getAvailableCollections() instead of the deprecated .collections

* 2024-01-12 jmcarcell ([PR#536](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/536))
  - Add a `getAvailableCollections` method in python that does the same thing as in C++

* 2023-12-19 tmadlener ([PR#535](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/535))

  - Fix a small resource leak in SIO.
  - Fix a small copy-paste error in test output (only triggered in case test fails)
  - Restore ostream state after altering it for formatting.

* 2023-12-19 tmadlener ([PR#534](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/534))
  - Update the coverity workflow to use EL9

* 2023-12-18 Andre Sailer ([PR#533](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/533))
  - rootUtils: include sstream, fixes build on macOS 12 / 13

* 2023-12-18 tmadlener ([PR#532](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/532))
  - Remove some benchmark utilities that became unused with the removal of the `TimedReader` and `TimedWriter` classes in #485

* 2023-12-15 tmadlener ([PR#531](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/531))
  - Remove the last few deprecated accessors from `GenericParameters`.

# v00-17-04

* 2023-12-14 tmadlener ([PR#527](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/527))
  - Split the `ClassGenerator` into a base class (mixin) and two specific c++ and julia code generators that only deal with their language specific needs.
    - Instantiate and configure the correct reader in the `podio_class_generator.py` main script depending on the desired language.
  - Slightly cleanup the `MemberVariable` to declutter its `__init__` method a bit.

* 2023-12-13 tmadlener ([PR#530](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/530))
  - Remove the reading of the deprecated old-style format of component definitions in the YAML files.

* 2023-12-13 tmadlener ([PR#485](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/485))

  - Switch the relation range tests to use Frame based I/O.

* 2023-12-06 tmadlener ([PR#526](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/526))
  - Switch the edm4hep workflows to an LCG stack with a recent enough version of CMake. Necessary after key4hep/EDM4hep#235

* 2023-12-05 jmcarcell ([PR#523](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/523))
  - Remove comment with file name and line number. It's very unlikely it remains up to date when either the name or the content of the files changes

* 2023-12-04 jmcarcell ([PR#521](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/521))
  - Do not import ROOT when using `podio-dump --help`, otherwise it can take a while depending on the system only to print the help.

* 2023-12-04 tmadlener ([PR#514](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/514))
  - Introduce the `MaybeSharedPtr` to manage the `Obj*` in the user facing handle classes.
    - This splits the control block and the managed object into two distinct entities with potentially different lifetimes, which allows to fix #174 and #492.
    - **This increases the size of the user facing handle classes by a factor two**, since they are now effectively two pointers instead of one, even if the control block will not be initialized in case a handle is obtained from a collection.
  - Remove the `ObjBase` base class and make the `ObjectID` a member of the `Obj` classes.
  - Make the user facing handle class constructors from an `Obj*` private as users will not have access to raw `Obj*` in any case.
    - Introduce a static `makeEmpty` method for the generated classes in order to create an empty handle, which is also used internally to handle unpersisted relations.
  - Enable more existing test cases in sanitizer workflows now that it has become possible to do so.

* 2023-12-04 Ananya Gupta ([PR#473](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/473))
  - Added Julia code generation support in the existing Python interface.
  - Implemented a new design structure for generated Julia code.
  - Added default parameters in constructor definitions with support for Abstract types (for builtins).
  - Created _sort_components_and_datatypes function to perform topological sort on components and datatypes.
  - Created _has_static_arrays_import to check for the need of using Static Arrays in the generated julia code.
  - Added --lang (-l) programming language argument to specify the programming language for code generation, current choices: cpp and julia, default: cpp.
  - Added --upstream-edm code generation support for julia.
  - Added tests in the unit test suite, covering the Julia code generation of the example data models.
  - Added documentation for julia code generation.
  - Added ENABLE_JULIA toggle option. By default it is OFF.

* 2023-12-01 jmcarcell ([PR#520](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/520))
  - Add an error message when there is an std::bad_function_call, which currently shows
    a stacktrace and is quite uninformative.

* 2023-12-01 tmadlener ([PR#519](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/519))
  - Make generated member getter functions return by value for builtin types. Keep return by const reference for all other types. Fixes #518

* 2023-12-01 tmadlener ([PR#488](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/488))
  - Add python bindings for the RNTuple reader and writer 
  - Make `podio-dump` understand RNTuple based files
  - Fix missing storage of datamodel definitions for RNTuple based files

# v00-17-03

* 2023-11-14 tmadlener ([PR#513](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/513))
  - Introduce checks in `ROOTFrameWriter::writeFrame` and `ROOTNTupleWriter::writeFrame` that ensure consistent contents for all Frames of a given category. If inconsistent contents are found an exception is thrown. Before these changes this might lead to a crash or to unreadable files. Fixes #382 
  - Refactor `ROOTNTupleWriter` internals to have only one map that keeps track of categories instead of two maps and a set that need to be kept consistent.

# v00-17-02

* 2023-11-08 jmcarcell ([PR#511](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/511))
  - Decouple generation tools and files from the rest of the podio python files by creating a new folder called `podio_gen`. **This is a transparent change for users that only use the generator script.**
    - This makes the configuration / generation times negligible again, because we don't load libraries unnecessarily any longer for the generation.
  - Simplify the python bindings (`podio`) `__init__.py` and remove the `test_utils` from it.
  - Move the tests for writing frames in python to the `tests` folder, where they belong and also test the SIO python writer.

* 2023-11-06 jmcarcell ([PR#510](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/510))
  - Fix legacy tests; an extra argument was being passed and default in the .cpp file `example_frame.root` was being used which (almost) always exists (because there is a another test creating it) so it was hard to notice.

* 2023-11-06 jmcarcell ([PR#509](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/509))
  - Add an option for using clang format and set it to off by default. It is significantly slower to run cmake with this option on.

* 2023-11-02 jmcarcell ([PR#508](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/508))
  - Use the cmake ExternalData module to manage test data. This lets cmake take care of downloading the tests by hash so they can be version controlled. In addition, it's possible to set up a local store using `-DExternalData_OBJECT_STORES=/path/to/store` and it will download the test files there if they are not there but otherwise use them from there, so building from scratch won't download the test files again.

* 2023-10-16 jmcarcell ([PR#507](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/507))
  - Copy .clang-format to the dumpmodel test directory and fix some tests when the build directory is not a subdirectory of the main directory. In some tests `clang-format` will try to find a `.clang-format` looking in the directories above and if it doesn't exist it will format files differently and some tests will fail.

# v00-17-01

* 2023-10-12 tmadlener ([PR#505](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/505))
  - Bump the pylint version for CI to 2.17.7

* 2023-10-11 tmadlener ([PR#502](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/502))
  - Add a `deleteBuffers` function that is populated at generation time to the `CollectionReadBuffers` to make it possible to dispose of unconsumed buffers. This fixes the main leaks described in #500 
  - Make the `ROOTFrameData` clean up all unconsumed buffers at desctruction.
  - Make sure to delete buffers that are no longer necessary in the CollectionData constructor. This fixes some more leaks described in #500

* 2023-10-08 Wouter Deconinck ([PR#503](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/503))
  - Install podio-vis

* 2023-10-04 jmcarcell ([PR#497](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/497))
  - Move podio_PYTHON_DIR to the top level CMakeLists so that it is set even when BUILD_TESTING is off

* 2023-10-02 jmcarcell ([PR#496](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/496))
  - Add an operator != to fix negative comparisons since after https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/493 now `id()` returns a `podioObjectID`

* 2023-09-29 tmadlener ([PR#493](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/493))
  - Make `[Mutable]Object::id()` return a `podio::ObjectID` instead of `unsigned`, since the latter has become useless with #412. Fixes #438 
  - Add an `operator<<(std::ostream&)` for `podio::ObjectID`

# v00-17

* 2023-09-22 Juraj Smiesko ([PR#491](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/491))
  - podio-dump: print warning if requested entry not present in the file

* 2023-09-22 tmadlener ([PR#490](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/490))
  - Fix bugs in python imports when podio is built without SIO support. Fixes #489

* 2023-09-22 tmadlener ([PR#486](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/486))
  - Make sure to initialize `ObjectID`s to *untracked* to properly track whether they have been added to a Frame or not
  - Change `CollectionIDTable` interfaces of `name` and `collectionID` to return `optional` to signal whether a collection (ID) is known to the table. **This is a breaking change if you use the `CollectionIDTable`!**
    - Avoids having to do the lookup twice to check existence and a subsequent retrieval
  - Fix bug of overly shared CollectionIDTable in `ROOTNTupleReader` that was uncovered by the CollectionIDTable switch to optional returns.
  - Switch tests from EventStore to Frame based I/O.
  - Fix bug in Frame based I/O that lead to crashes when trying to resolve relations to unpersisted objects.

* 2023-09-18 tmadlener ([PR#484](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/484))
  - Make the podio python bindings import structure "feel more pythonic"

* 2023-09-15 Benedikt Hegner ([PR#483](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/483))

* 2023-09-15 Benedikt Hegner ([PR#482](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/482))
  - rename CMake macro createBuffers into create_buffers

* 2023-09-13 jmcarcell ([PR#481](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/481))
  - Rename the cmake executable or target `unittest` to `unittest_podio`, to avoid possible collisions since the `unittest` name is relatively common

* 2023-09-13 Benedikt Hegner ([PR#480](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/480))
  - Move the code generation of buffers into the 'create_buffers' macro

* 2023-09-13 Thomas Madlener ([PR#472](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/472))
  - Allow comparison of data schemata across versions
  - Provide syntax to clarify user intentions in schema evolution
  - Provide schema evolution implementation based on ROOT backend
  - Include infrastructure for future support for schema evolution in other backends
  - Documentation for schema evolution functionality

* 2023-09-11 tmadlener ([PR#477](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/477))
  - Use `nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp` in headers to reduce unnecessary template instantiations. Fixes #475

* 2023-09-08 tmadlener ([PR#478](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/478))
  - Add `empty` method to `CollectionBase`
  - Add `operator==` to the collection iterators

* 2023-09-08 Dmitry Kalinkin ([PR#465](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/465))
  - Introduce member typedefs to the user facing classes.
    - Object's collection type can now be referenced as `Object::collection_type`. Conversely, the object type is reachable as `ObjectCollection::value_type`. The mutable objects can be reached via `Object::mutable_type`.

* 2023-08-30 tmadlener ([PR#471](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/471))
  - Initialize the branch names to be index based for reading (i.e. legacy behavior) for all releases of the v00-16 series.

* 2023-08-22 Andre Sailer ([PR#469](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/469))
  - Tests: update required catch2 version to 3.4 for builds with c++20
  - CI: use clang16 on el9 (alma9), instead of clang12 on cs7, using c++20
  - CI: disable key4hep-release-based tests (`tabulate` available)

* 2023-08-22 Benedikt Hegner ([PR#445](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/445))
  - Allow to specify units as part of the datamodel definition

* 2023-07-26 tmadlener ([PR#463](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/463))
  - Make sure to only access vector member buffers of collections of datatypes with `VectorMembers` if they actually exist. This is necessary to make subset collections of such datatypes work in I/O. Fixes [#462](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/issues/462)
  - Add a test that reproduces the original issue and is fixed by this.

* 2023-07-25 tmadlener ([PR#461](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/461))
  - Make sure the `ROOTFrameReader` on the master branch can read `v00-16-06` files
  - Add `v00-16-06` to the legacy versions that are tested

  - Add a python wrapper around the different available Frame writers.
  - Add a `put` method to the `Frame` wrapper that allows to add collections to the Frame without having to explicitly use `cppyy.gbl.std.move`. Fixes #432 
  - Add test cases that write via python bindings and read via c++.

* 2023-07-20 tmadlener ([PR#457](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/457))
  - Simplify the test setup for SIO in CMake and make it explicit on the `ENABLE_SIO` option rather than on the presence of targets.

* 2023-07-18 jmcarcell ([PR#456](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/456))
  - Cache podio_PYTHON_DIR

* 2023-07-18 jmcarcell ([PR#455](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/455))

* 2023-07-18 tmadlener ([PR#439](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/439))
  - Introduce the `FrameCategories.h` header that puts a few of the conventions and otherwise hardcoded strings into variables / functions.

* 2023-07-14 jmcarcell ([PR#454](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/454))
  - Rename `CMAKE_{SOURCE,BIN}_DIR` to `PROJECT_{SOURCE,BIN}_DIR`

  - Add optional description and author fields to component definition

* 2023-07-13 tmadlener ([PR#449](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/449))
  - Fix the `pre-commit` workflow by making it run on top of the key4hep nightlies that come with a recent enough root version to be able to work with the RNTuple addition (#395)
  - Fix a few minor complaints from newer versions of `clang-format`, `clang-tidy` and `pylint`
  - Enable building the RNTuple backend for more workflows (anything that comes with a new enough ROOT essentially).

* 2023-07-13 tmadlener ([PR#448](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/448))
  - Remove the lcio datalayout which has been untouched (and unbuilt) for quite a few years.

* 2023-07-13 tmadlener ([PR#446](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/446))
  - Make calling `finish` for the `SIOFrameWriter` non-mandatory. See #442 for other related changes.

* 2023-07-11 jmcarcell ([PR#442](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/442))
  - Allow not calling `finish()` when using the writers

* 2023-07-11 jmcarcell ([PR#395](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/395))
  - Add support for the new RNTuple format by adding a writer, reader and tests.

* 2023-06-30 Ananya Gupta ([PR#437](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/437))
  - Modified parse function definition to incorporate `missing description in member definition` error message. Fixes #436

* 2023-06-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#413](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/413))
  - Introduce `podio::SchemaEvolution` that can hold schema evolution functions and that offers an `evolveBuffers` method that does the schema evolution on these buffers before collections are created.
  - Add hooks in `podio::Frame` to call this when collections are read from the FrameData.

* 2023-06-23 tmadlener ([PR#434](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/434))
  - Properly handle the slightly different branch contents before `v00-16-04`. Fixes #433 
  - Add tests that use the `ROOTLegacyReader` to actually read the downloaded legacy files

* 2023-06-15 tmadlener ([PR#428](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/428))
  - Split the tests directory into several (more or less) topical sub-directories to declutter the main test `CMakeLists.txt` a bit
  - Move commonly used functionality into `cmake/podioTests.cmake` (e.g. setting up a test environment)
  - Move python unittests config to the `python` directory

* 2023-06-15 tmadlener ([PR#427](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/427))
  - Delay library loading as long as possible, mainly for quicker responses for `--help`
  - Add a `--version` flag for dumping the podio version
  - Display collections and parameters in alphabetical order and automatically adjust column widths to fit contents (using the `tabulate` package).

* 2023-06-09 Thomas Madlener ([PR#402](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/402))
  - Add public `static constexpr char*` type names to the collections and make the `getXXXName()` methods return `string_view`s to these strings. **This is a breaking change to the interface of the collections if you explicitly rely on them being `std::string`**
    - `typeName`: the full type name of the collection (returned also by `getTypeName`)
    - `valueTypeName`: the (immutable) type name of the objects of the collection (returned by `getValueTypeName`)
    - `dataTypeName`: the type name of the data PODs (returned by `getDataTypeName`)
  - Make unittest environment properly use `PODIO_SIOBLOCK_PATH`
  - `USE_EXTERNAL_CATCH2` now can also be set to `AUTO` to look for a suitable version of Catch2 before falling back and fetching and building it's own version instead of a hard fail.

* 2023-06-08 tmadlener ([PR#426](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/426))
  - Check if `PODIO_SIOBLOCK_PATH` exists in the environment and use that to look for SIO Blocks libraries before falling back to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This makes it possible to make slightly more robust environments if several (incompatible) podio installations are visible on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

* 2023-06-08 tmadlener ([PR#425](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/425))
  - Add a `SKIP_CATCH_DISCOVERY` cmake option to skip the unittest discovery of Catch2 to avoid running the catch discovery in an unsuitable environment.
  - Make environment for unittests more specific to avoid catching too much of the underlying environment.

* 2023-06-08 tmadlener ([PR#412](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/412))
  - Using string hashes as CollectionID based on MurmurHash

* 2023-06-05 tmadlener ([PR#423](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/423))
  - Add some more structure to make it easier to add more legacy tests.
    - Use this to download more legacy files automatically
    - Restructure CMake config to make this possible
  - Add tests for Frame based root I/O reading files that have been produced with prior versions of podio
  - Add more tests for EventStore based root I/O reading files that have been produced with prior versions of podio

* 2023-06-05 tmadlener ([PR#421](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/421))
  - Make the collections appear in alphabetical order in root files, using a case insensitive sorting of the collections that are written.

  - Make the branch names for relations and vector members more legible and valid c++ variable names to improve interoperability with RDataFrame. Fixes #169 
    - The branch names will have the following structure: `_<collection-name>_<relation-name>`, resp. `_<collection-name>_<vectormember-name>`, where `relation-name`, resp.`vectormember-name` are taken from the YAML definitions.
    - Subset collections will have a single branch with `<collection-name>_objIdx`. This makes it easier to disambiguate them from normal collections.
  - **This is a breaking change if you use the root files directly! If you use the podio Readers/Writers everything should be transparent**

* 2022-11-10 Thomas Madlener ([PR#343](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/343))
  - Add python bindings for `Frame` based I/O
    - Available from `podio.root_io` and `podio.sio_io`, where a `Reader` and a `Writer` is implemented for each.
    - Wrapper around `podio::Frame`. **Requires that the `podio/Frame.h` header is available somewhere on the `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH`**.
  - Add necessary functionality for python bindings to C++ API
    - untyped `Frame::get` method for getting collections
    - New constructor from `FrameDataT&&`
    - functionality to inspect file and `Frame` contents more easily
  - Reorganize python code into structure that follows the usual python packaging conventions a bit more closely

* 2022-09-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#323](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/323))
  - Add a `podio-dump` python script (installed to `<prefix>/bin` that can be used to dump event contents to stdout. By default prints an overview over the collections and their types, but can also be used to dump full events, via the `-d` or `--detailed` flag. Use `--help` to get all available options and their descriptions.
  - To allow `podio-dump` to work with all available backends also add support for reading SIO via the `PythonEventStore`.
    - Split off the necessary c++ functionality into a separate `podioPythonStore` library (+ necessary ROOT dictionaries).
  - Add a `print` function to the collections for easier dumping from the python side.
  - Add a `print` function to the `GenericParameters`
  - Make `goToEvent` is a part of the `IReader` interface and correctly implemented it for the `SIOReader`.

* 2022-09-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#287](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/287))
  - Introduce the `podio::Frame` as a generalized, thread-safe (event) data container.
    - This first version offers all necessary functionality and an almost finalized interface, i.e. we plan to keep this as stable as possible, but we might still change things if it turns out that there are better ways to do some things
    - For details about the basic interface and the underlying design considerations please consult the corresponding [documentation](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/doc/frame.md)
  - **This will be the only way to work with podio data starting from version 1.0**
    - For now the current I/O implementations remain in place unchanged, but they will be deprecated (and removed) in the not too distant future

  - Add support for converting objects and collections to JSON using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
    - To enable JSON support it is necessary to build the datamodel with `PODIO_JSON_OUTPUT` and to link against the nlohmann/json library.

  - CMake: PODIO_ADD_ROOT_IO_DICT: Bugfix for data models in `OUTPUT_FOLDER` not equal to source dir in root dictionary generation cmake macro. 
    - Now `SELECTION_XML` can be passed either as absolute path or relative to `OUTPUT_FOLDER`.

* 2022-08-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#317](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/317))
  - Make it possible to pass an upstream datamodel to the class generator such that datatypes and components defined there can be used in an unrelated datamodel. This makes it possible to extend datamodels and to prototype new datatypes with the aim of upstreaming them eventually without having to redefine all the necessary components.
  - Refactor the internals of the config reader / class generator slightly to make it possible to hold multiple datamodels in memory

* 2022-08-02 Thomas Madlener ([PR#316](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/316))
  - Remove macOS CI workflows because github hosted runners will deprecate macOS 10.15 ([announcement](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/5583)) and later versions of macOS no longer support fuse and as a consequence CVMFS.

* 2022-07-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#315](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/315))

* 2022-07-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#283](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/283))
  - Allow users to define default values for member variables, instead of default initializing all of them.
    - The syntax for specifying a default value is `- <type> <name>{<init-value>} // <description>`.
    - The passed value is not validated in any way. **Apart from a very basic syntax check, there is no validation that the provided default initialization values are actually valid**. This means that generated code might not compile.
  - Remove some of the python2 compatibility and do some cleanup

* 2022-07-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#276](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/276))

* 2022-06-21 Thomas Madlener ([PR#282](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/282))
  - Add a `PODIO_USE_CLANG_FORMAT` option to the cmake configuration to toggle the autodiscovery of `clang-format` and a `.clang-format` configuration file. This option is also available for downstream packages that use podio to generate their EDM. 
    - The default is `AUTO`, where we try to discover a suitable `clang-format` version as well as a `.clang-format` file and use it if we find it.
    - If set to `OFF` podio will not try to see whether `clang-format` and a `.clang-format` file are available and will also not try to format the code accordingly.
    - If set to `ON` podio will actually require a suitable `clang-format` version and the presence of a `.clang-format` file and will fail at the cmake stage if not present.

* 2022-06-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#305](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/305))

  - Replace the `obj_needs_destructor` flag in the generator code and templates with the `is_trivial_type` flag, since that is the more appropriate name. (Fixes #288)

* 2022-05-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#274](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/274))
  - Add documentation for the Jinja2 templates and the code generation process in general to make working with these parts of PODIO easier.

  - Make sure the `EventStore` doesn't try to read event meta data multiple times per event
  - Add a `empty` method to `GenericParameters` to check if any parameters are stored.

  - Only use `--color` option for diff in `clang-format` wrapper script if it is supported by the underlying `diffutils`.

* 2022-04-02 Thomas Madlener ([PR#254](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/254))
  - Add a `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` config file for consistent formatting and following a few coding guidelines.
  - Add pre-commit hooks that run `clang-tidy` and `clang-format` 
  - Make all currently present files follow the formatting and guidelines of the present configuration.
  - Make the `PODIO_GENERATE_DATAMODEL` macro look for a `.clang-format` file and the presence of `clang-format`and automatically format all the generated files if both are there.

* 2022-04-01 Thomas Madlener ([PR#279](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/279))

  - Extend the `podioVersion.h` header that is configured by cmake to hold some version utilities.
    - `podio::version::Version` class holding three `uint16_t`s for major, minor and patch version, plus `constexpr` comparison operators.
    - static const(expr) `podio::version::build_version` that holds the current (i.e. last tag) version of podio
    - Add preprocessor macros with similar functionality
      - `PODIO_VERSION` takes a major, minor and a patch version number and encodes it into a 64 bit version constant. 
      - `PODIO_[MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH]_VERSION` macros can extracts these values again from a 64 bit encoded version. 
      - `PODIO_BUILD_VERSION` holds the 64 bit encoded current (i.e. last tag) version of podio
  - Reorder the read tests slightly and make some sections version dependent
  - Add legacy file read test from #230

* 2022-01-28 Thomas Madlener ([PR#256](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/256))

* 2022-01-24 Placido Fernandez Declara ([PR#235](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/235))
  - Fix crashes that happen when reading collections that have related objects in collections that have not been persisted.
  - Fix similar crashes for subset collections where the original collection has not been persisted.
    - The expected behavior in both cases is that podio does not crash when reading such collections, but only once the user tries to actually access such a missing object. Each object has an `isAvailable` function to guard against such crashes if need be.
  - Add a test that makes sure that the expected behavior is the one that is observed.
  - Fix a somewhat related bug in `setReferences` which was mistakenly a no-op for collections of a type without relations. Since this is the mechanism we use for restoring subset collections it obviously has to be present for all types.

* 2022-01-21 Thomas Madlener ([PR#252](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/252))
  - Make the `CollectionData` classes use `unique_ptr` instead of raw pointers, wherever they actually own the pointer.
  - Implement move constructors and move assignment operators for collections. Thanks to the usage of `unique_ptr` for ownership management in the `CollectionData`, these can be `default`ed in `Collection` and `CollectionData`.
  - Add a few tests to check that moving collections actually works.

* 2022-01-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#251](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/251))
  - Make sure that collections of types without relations can still be used properly as subset collections. Previous to these changes, the necessary functionality was not generated if a datatype had no relations (i.e. not a single `OneToOneRelation` or `OneToManyRelation`).
  - Add a check of this functionality to the write/read tests.

* 2022-01-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#249](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/249))
  - Add a `USE_SANITIZER` build option to more easily build podio with sanitizers for testing. Curently `Address`, `Memory[WithOrigin]`, `Undefined` and `Thread` are available as options. Given the limitations of the sanitizers these are more or less mutually exlusive.
  - Label all the Catch2 test cases which makes it easier to run them selectively.
  - For builds with sanitizers enabled, by default ignore tests with known failures, but add a `FORCE_RUN_ALL_TESTS` cmake option that overrides this for local development.
  - Run CI workflows with a selection of sanitizers enabled (on a limited list of tests).

    - Collections are marked as prepared, either if they are read from file or once `prepareForWrite` has been called on them.

* 2021-12-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#205](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/205))
  - Make the default classes immutable and mark mutable classes explictly via their class name (e.g. `Hit` and `MutableHit`). See a brief discussion in #204 for more details on the reasons for this **breaking change**.
  - After these changes collections return mutable objects via their `create` functionality, and will only give access to the default (immutable) objects when they are `const` (e.g. when they are read from file).
  - In general these changes should make it easier for users to write interface that behave as expected, and also make it very obvious where objects are actually mutated already from looking at an interface definition.

  - add possibility to store additional user data as collections of fundamental types in PODIO files
       -  uses `std::vector<basic_type>`
       - stored in simple branch in root (and simple block in SIO)
       - all fundamental types supported in PODIO (except bool) can be written
  - example code:
  ```c++
    auto& usrInts = store.create<podio::UserDataCollection<uint64_t> >("userInts");
    auto& usrDoubles = store.create<podio::UserDataCollection<double> >("userDoubles");
    // ...
  
    // add some unsigned ints
    usrInts.resize( i + 1 ) ;
    int myInt = 0 ;
    for( auto& iu : usrInts ){
      iu = myInt++  ;
    }
    // and some user double values
    unsigned nd = 100 ;
    usrDoubles.resize( nd ) ;
    for(unsigned id=0 ; id<nd ; ++id){
      usrDoubles[id] = 42. ;

  - Generate an additional `podio_generated_files.cmake` file containing all generated source files as a `header` and `sources` list and make the code generation macro include this file to get the headers and source files.
    - Now only the files generated for the current settings are picked up by cmake
    - Makes it possible to have additional files in the folders where the generated files are placed, since these are no longer globbed over.

* 2021-09-10 Thomas Madlener ([PR#217](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/217))

* 2021-08-18 Thomas Madlener ([PR#210](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/210))
  - Fix a few small issues in the datamodel yaml file validation. **These do not change the behavior of code generation, they just try to catch problems earlier**
    - Make sure that `OneToManyRelations` and `OneToOneRelations` have the same restrictions
    - Only allow `components`, builtins and arrays of those as `Members`
  - Make the API of `validate` slightly more generic by taking a dict instead of multiple arguments.
  - Make the generator exit with an easier to read error message in case of a validation problem instead of printing a full backtrace.

* 2021-08-18 Thomas Madlener ([PR#197](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/197))
  - Introduce a `podio::CollectionBuffers` class that contains everything that is necessary for I/O of a given collection. **This is a breaking change in the collection interface** 
  - Introduce  and generate a `CollectionData` class for each datatype that only manages the storage of a given collection.
    - Exposes only the `Obj` entries of each collection as well as the necessary functionality to add a new object (and its relations) to the collection.
  - Implement "subset" collections that behave exactly the same as normal collections apart from an additional function call when creating them.

* 2021-08-13 Thomas Madlener ([PR#206](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/206))
  - Switch to Catch2 v3 test library and by default assume that it is available. Use the 'USE_EXTERNAL_CATCH2` cmake option to control whether podio should use an external installation or if it should fetch and build it internally instead.
  - Remove `catch.hpp` header that was previously shipped, since it is no longer needed.

  - Add support for [fixed width integer type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer) members in components and datatypes.
    - Now possible to use `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` as members. Other fixed width integer types that are potentially defined in `<cstdint>` are not considered valid as the intended use case is really only fixed width integers for now. These are rejected at the datamodel validation step.
    - Fixed width integers are considered to be "builtin" types for podio.

* 2021-05-04 Valentin Volkl ([PR#189](https://github.com/aidasoft/PODIO/pull/189))
  - [cmake] fix test dependencies: `read_and_write.cpp` reads the file `example.root` that is created by the write test. If the dependency is not declared, running the tests concurrently can lead to spurious test failures.

* 2021-04-28 tmadlener ([PR#180](https://github.com/aidasoft/PODIO/pull/180))
  - Improve the branch look-up logic in ROOTReader and ROOTWriter. Triggered by a performance degradation in v6.22/06, where this logic was changed inside ROOT and our use case was affected badly. All ROOT versions profit from these changes as it is in general more efficient than the previous implementation.

This fixes a bug described in https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/issues/168#issuecomment-770751871 and now allows to mix different namespaces in the generated code. This allows to more easily extend already existing datamodels by compiling and linking against them.

* 2020-12-18 tmadlener ([PR#155](https://github.com/aidasoft/PODIO/pull/155))
  - Add some benchmarking tools, including `TimedReader` and `TimedWriter` decorators that allow to wrap (interface conforming) readers and writers and record the times different operations take. The times are recorded on two levels: setup times, like constructing a reader or "one-time" calls and per event times, for things that happen each event (e.g. `writeEvent` or `readCollection`). Additionally the `BenchmarkRecorder` in principle also allows to track additional things outside of these decorators.

  - fix for MacOs when using SIO I/O with podio
        - need to link edm-core library to edm-sioBlocks library

* 2020-11-10 Thomas Madlener ([PR#130](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/130))
  - Add SIO as a second I/O backend (as alternative to ROOT) that can be enabled with `ENABLE_SIO`. If enabled, a separate `podioSioIO` library is built that allows reading and writing sio files. For serializing the different datatypes, additional code is generated to build an `SioBlocks` library that is loaded at runtime (if found somewhere on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). To facilitate the whole process at the cmake level, **new cmake functions** are provided to generate the core datamodel library **`PODIO_ADD_DATAMODEL_CORE_LIBRARY`**, to (conditionally) define the ROOT dictionary target **`PODIO_ADD_ROOT_IO_DICT`** and to (conditionally) define the Sio Blocks library target **`PODIO_ADD_SIO_IO_BLOCKS`**. The I/O backends that are supported by podio are exported via the **`PODIO_IO_HANDLERS`** list variable.
  - `podio_generate_datamodel.py` now additionally takes the I/O handlers that should be generated as arguments. This is also reflected in an additional argument to `PODIO_GENERATE_DATAMODEL`. To have backwards compatibility, this additional argument defaults to ROOT in both cases and downstream packages should work as usual without changes.

  - Update Ubuntu CI script to install the python requirements via pip.

* 2020-08-11 tmadlener ([PR#120](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/120))
  - Use `jinja2` template engine to generate c++ code. This makes it possible to more cleanly separate the generation of the c++ code and all the necessary pre-processing. Now only the pre-processing is done in python, while the complete generation is done using `jinja2`. This should make it much easier to make changes to the generated c++ code.

* 2020-08-05 tmadlener ([PR#117](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/117))
  - Refactoring of the podio class generator to improve its readability. This refactoring is mainly focusing on reducing the size of some methods to make them easier to grasp as well as trying to more cleanly separate the validation of the inputs and the c++ code generation.  **The validation is stricter than the current version and will potentially break things. Specifically, the handling of `ExtraCode` and `ConstExtraCode` is now implemented according to the documentation.** In the previous version this has somewhat diverged from there. **The yaml declaration of `components` has been made equivalent to the ones of the `datatypes` but "old-style" definitions are still handled properly.** In the latter case a deprecation warning is emitted. **The generated c++ code is functionally equivalent, but not equal character by character.** The differences are mainly whitespace, but at some places also some of the generated code has been updated to more recent c++ capabilities. Additionally, some tests for the validation are added. They are not really exhaustive and should be considered to serve mainly documenting purposes for the moment.

  - Point to libpodioDict.so instead of libpodio.so in rootmap file

* 2020-06-03 Frank Gaede ([PR#92](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio/pull/92))
  - implement reading/writing of meta data for runs, events and collections
       - based on GenericParameters that hold named parameters of type `int, float, string` or vectors if these (copied from `lcio::LCParameters`)
       - meta data for the three types is always written 
       - it is read only on request
  - example for writing:
  ```
     auto& evtMD = store.getEventMetaData() ;
      evtMD.setValue( "UserEventWeight" , (float) 100.*i ) ;
  ```
  - example for reading:
  ```
    auto& evtMD = store.getEventMetaData() ;
    float evtWeight = evtMD.getFloatVal( "UserEventWeight" ) ;
  
  ```
  - addresses #49
