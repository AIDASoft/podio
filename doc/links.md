# Linking unrelated objects with each other
Sometimes it is necessary to build links between objects whose datatypes are
not related via a `OneToOneRelation` or a `OneToManyRelation`. These *external
relations* are called *Links* in podio, and they are implemented as a
templated version of the code that would be generated by the following yaml
snippet (in this case between generic `FromT` and `ToT` datatypes):

```yaml
Link:
  Description: "A weighted link between a FromT and a ToT"
  Author: "P. O. Dio"
  Members:
    - float weight // the weight of the link
  OneToOneRelations:
    - FromT from // reference to the FromT
    - ToT to     // reference to the ToT
```

## `Link` basics
`Link`s are implemented as templated classes forming a similar structure
as other podio generated classes, with several layers of which users only ever
interact with the *User layer*. This layer has the following basic classes
```cpp
/// The collection class that forms the basis of I/O and also is the main entry point
template<typename FromT, typename ToT>
class LinkCollection;

/// The default (immutable) class that one gets after reading a collection
template<typename FromT, typename ToT>
class Link;

/// The mutable class for creating links before writing them
template<typename FromT, typename ToT>
class MutableLink;
```

Although the names of the template parameters, `FromT` and `ToT` imply a
direction of the link, from a technical point of view nothing actually
enforces this direction, unless `FromT` and `ToT` are both of the same type.
Hence, links can effectively be treated as bi-directional, and one
combination of `FromT` and `ToT` should be enough for all use cases (see also
the [usage section](#how-to-use-links)).

For a more detailed explanation of the internals and the actual implementation
see [the implementation details](#implementation-details).

## How to use `Link`s
Using `Link`s is quite simple. The most straight forward way is to simply
declare them as part of the datamodel, [as described
here](datamodel_syntax.md#definition-of-links). That will result in code
generation that effectiely does what is described here. However, it's not
strictly necessary to do that in case non-generated code is preferred. In line
with other datatypes that are generated by podio all the functionality can be
gained by including the corresponding `Collection` header. After that it is
generally recommended to introduce a type alias for easier usage. **As a general
rule `Links` need to be declared with the default (immutable) types.** Trying to
instantiate them with `Mutable` types will result in a compilation error.

```cpp
#include "podio/LinkCollection.h"

#include "edm4hep/MCParticleCollection.h"
#include "edm4hep/ReconstructedParticleCollection.h"

// declare a new link type
using MCRecoParticleLinkCollection = podio::LinkCollection<edm4hep::MCParticle,
                                                           edm4hep::ReconstructedParticle>;
```

This can now be used exactly as any other podio generated collection, i.e.
```cpp
edm4hep::MCParticle mcParticle{};
edm4hep::ReconstructedParticle recoParticle{};

auto mcRecoLinks = MCRecoParticleLinkCollection{};
auto link = mcRecoLinks.create(); // create an link;
link.setFrom(mcParticle);
link.setTo(recoParticle);
link.setWeight(1.0); // This is also the default value!
```

and similar for getting the linked objects
```cpp
auto mcP = link.getFrom();
auto recoP = link.getTo();
auto weight = link.getWeight();
```

In the above examples the `From` and `To` in the method names imply a direction,
but it is also possible to use a templated `get` and `set` method to retrieve
the linked objects via their type:

```cpp
link.set(mcParticle);
link.set(recoParticle);

auto mcP = link.get<edm4hep::MCParticle>();
auto recoP = link.get<edm4hep::ReconstructedParticle>();
auto weight = link.getWeight();
```

It is also possible to access the elements of a link via an index based
`get` (similar to `std::tuple`). In this case `0` corresponds to `getFrom`, `1`
corresponds to `getTo` and `2` corresponds to the weight. The main purpose of
this feature is to enable structured bindings:

```cpp
const auto& [mcP, recoP, weight] = link;
```

The above three examples are three equivalent ways of retrieving the same things
from an `Link`. **The templated `get` and `set` methods are only available
if `FromT` and `ToT` are not the same type** and will lead to a compilation
error otherwise.

### Enabling I/O capabilities for `Link`s

`Link`s do not have I/O support out of the box. This has to be enabled via
the `PODIO_DECLARE_LINK` macro (defined in the `LinkCollection.h`
header). If you simply want to be able to read / write `Link`s in a
standalone executable, it is enough to use this macro somewhere in the
executable, e.g. to enable I/O capabilities for the `MCRecoParticleLink`s
used above this would look like:

```cpp
PODIO_DECLARE_LINK(edm4hep::MCParticle, edm4hep::ReconstructedParticle)
```

The macro will also enable SIO support if the `PODIO_ENABLE_SIO=1` is passed to
the compiler. This is done by default when linking against the
`podio::podioSioIO` library in CMake.

For enabling I/O support for shared datamodel libraries, it is necessary to have
all the necessary combinations of types declared via `PODIO_DECLARE_LINK`
and have that compiled into the library. This is necessary if you want to use
the python bindings, since they rely on dynamically loading the datamodel
libraries.

## Implementation details

In order to give a slightly easier entry to the details of the implementation
and also to make it easier to find where things in the generated documentation,
we give a brief description of the main ideas and design choices here. With
those it should be possible to dive deeper if necessary or to understand the
template structure that is visible in the documentation, but should be fairly
invisible in usage. We will focus mainly on the user facing classes, as those
deal with the most complexity, the underlying layers are more or less what could
be obtained by generating them via the yaml snippet above and sprinkling some
`<FromT, ToT>` templates where necessary.

### File structure

The user facing `"podio/LinkCollection.h"` header essentially just
defines the `PODIO_DECLARE_LINK` macro (depending on whether SIO support
is desired and possible or not). All the actual implementation is done in the
following files:

- [`"podio/detail/LinkCollectionImpl.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/LinkCollectionImpl.h):
  for the collection functionality
- [`"podio/detail/Link.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/Link.h):
  for the functionality of single link
- [`"podio/detail/LinkCollectionIterator.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/LinkCollectionIterator.h):
  for the collection iterator functionality
- [`"podio/detail/LinkObj.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/LinkObj.h):
  for the object layer functionality
 - [`"podio/detail/LinkCollectionData.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/LinkCollectionData.h):
  for the collection data functionality
- [`"podio/detail/LinkFwd.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/LinkFwd.h):
  for some type helper functionality and some forward declarations that are used
  throughout the other headers
- [`"podio/detail/LinkSIOBlock.h"`](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/include/podio/detail/LinkSIOBlock.h):
  for defining the SIOBlocks that are necessary to use SIO

As is visible from this structure, we did not introduce an `LinkData`
class, since that would effectively just be a `float` wrapped inside a `struct`.

### Default and `Mutable` `Link` classes

A quick look into the `LinkFwd.h` header will reveal that the default and
`Mutable` `Link` classes are in fact just partial specialization of the
`LinkT` class that takes a `bool Mutable` as third template argument. The
same approach is also followed by the `LinkCollectionIterator`s:

```cpp
template<typename FromT, typename ToT, bool Mutable>
class LinkT;

template <typename FromT, typename ToT>
using Link = LinkT<FromT, ToT, false>;

template <typename FromT, typename ToT>
using MutableLink = LinkT<FromT, ToT, true>;
```

Throughout the implementation it is assumed that `FromT` and `ToT` always are the
default handle types. This is ensured through `static_assert`s in the
`LinkCollection` to make sure it can only be instantiated with those. The
`GetDefaultHandleType` helper templates are used to retrieve the correct type
from any `FromT` regardless of whether it is a mutable or a default handle type
With this in mind, effectively all mutating operations on `Link`s are
defined using [*SFINAE*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae)
using the following template structure (taking here `setFrom` as an example)

```cpp
template <typename FromU,
          typename = std::enable_if_t<Mutable &&
                                      std::is_same_v<detail::GetDefaultHandleType<FromU>, FromT>>>
void setFrom(FromU value);
```

This is a SFINAE friendly way to ensure that this definition is only viable if
the following conditions are met
- The object this method is called on has to be `Mutable`. (first part inside the `std::enable_if`)
- The passed in `value` is either a `Mutable` or default class of type `FromT`. (second part inside the `std::enable_if`)

In some cases the template signature looks like this

```cpp
template<bool Mut = Mutable,
         typename = std::enable_if<Mut && Mutable>>
void setWeight(float weight);
```

The reason to have a defaulted `bool` template parameter here is the same as the
one for having a `typename FromU` template parameter above: SFINAE only works
with deduced types. Using `Mut && Mutable` in the `std::enable_if` makes sure
that users cannot bypass the immutability by specifying a template parameter
themselves.
