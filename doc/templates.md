# Changing / creating new templates

PODIO uses the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) template engine to generate the c++ code from the yaml description.
This document here gives an overview of how PODIO uses the Jinja2 engine and how the yaml file is processed before it is passed to it.
We don't go into many details of Jinja2 templates here, please refer to the [Template Designer Document](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/) of Jinja2.
PODIO only makes use of rather basic Jinja2 templates, so it should in principle be possible to pick up the basics just by looking at some existing templates.

## Preprocessing of yaml file

The entry point for reading yaml files is the [`python/podio_gen/podio_config_reader.py`](/python/podio_gen/podio_config_reader.py).
When reading the yaml file a basic validation is run and the data members, relations and vector members of components and datatypes are parsed into `MemberVariable` objects (defined in [`python/podio_gen/generator_utils.py`](/python/podio_gen/generator_utils.py)).
The main entry point to the code generation is the [`python/podio_class_generator.py`](/python/podio_class_generator.py) which takes care of instantiating the language specific code generator (either C++ or a prototype version for Julia at this point).
The language specific generators inherit from the [`ClassGeneratorBaseMixin`](/python/podio_gen/generator_base.py) which takes care of some common initialization and provides some common functionality for code generation.
 In the end each language specific generator will take care of (either by itself or through the common functionality in `ClassGeneratorBaseMixin`):
- Configuring the Jinja2 template engine. At the moment this is mainly making the templates known to the engine.
- The necessary preprocessing of all the datatypes and components. This includes collecting necessary include directories and forward declaration, as well as digesting `ExtraCode` snippets.
- Putting all the necessary information into a `dict` that can be easily used in the Jinja2 templates. See [below](#available-information-in-the-templates) for what is available in the templates
- Calling the template engine to fill the necessary templates for each datatype or component and making sure to only write to disk if the filled template actually changed. Optionally run `clang-format` on them before writing.
- Producing a list of generated c++ files for consumption by the cmake macros of PODIO.

Currently two language specific generators are available: [`CPPClassGenerator`](/python/podio_gen/cpp_generator.py) and [`JuliaClassGenerator`](/python/podio_gen/julia_generator.py).
Note that some of the information below will only apply to either of these generators as they provide the template engine with slightly different content.

## Existing templates

Currently PODIO loads templates that are placed in [`<prefix>/python/templates`](/python/templates).
They are broadly split along the classes that are generated for each datatype or component from the EDM definition:

| template file(s)                   | content                                                                                                                                                    | generated file(s)                                                                     |

The presence of a `[<package>]` subdirectory for the header files is controlled by the `includeSubfolder` option in the yaml definition file.

Jinja allows the definition of additional macros and supports importing them similar to python modules.
These are stored in the [`macros`](/python/templates/macros) subfolder and are imported directly by the main templates where necessary.

## Adding a new template
All templates that are placed in the templates directory mentioned [above](#existing-templates) become immediately available to the template engine if it ends on `.jinja2`
However, it is still necessary to actively fill them from the class generator.
If the available information for the new templates is already enough and no further pre-processing is necessary, than they need to be added to `_get_filenames_templates` function in the `ClassGeneratorBaseMixin`.
The `prefix` and `postfix` dictionaries define how the template filename will be mapped to the generated files: `<prefix><template-filename><postfix>`.
By default a `.h` and a `.cc` file will be generated, but this can be overridden by adding the template to the `endings` dictionary.
With that in place it is now only necessary to call `_fill_templates` with the appropriate template name and the pre processed data.
Note that for most templates this means that they have to be filled for each datatype or component individually.

If additional preprocessing is necessary, it will be necessary to also add that to the language specific generators.
The main entry point to the generation is the `process` method which essentially just delegates to other methods.

## Available information in the templates

The following gives an overview of the information that is available from the dictionary that is passed to the templates from the different
Each (top level) key in this dict is directly available as a variable in the Jinja2 templates, e.g.
```python
component['includes'] = # list of includes
```
will become available as
```jinja2
{% for include in includes %}
{{ include }}
{% endfor %}
```

**Be aware that some of the information is only available for the language
specific generators**. The following information mostly applies to the c++ code
generation!

### `MemberVariable`
Defined in [`python/generator_utils.py`](/python/generator_utils.py).
The string representation gives the definition of the member, including a potentially present description string.
In principle all members are accessible in the templates, however, the most important ones are:

| field         | description                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `getter_name` | Method for generating the correct name for getter functions, depending on the `getSyntax` option in the yaml definition file.                                               |
| `setter_name` | Method for generating the correct name for setter functions, depending on the `getSyntax` option in the yaml definition file and on whether the member is a relation or not |
| `signature`   | The signature of a data member that can be used in function signatures, corresponds to `{{ full_type }} {{ name }}`                                                         |

| `julia_type`  | Equivalent julia type for the c++ type                                                                                                                                      |

### `DataType`
Defined in [`python/generator_utils.py`](/python/generator_utils.py).
This is essentially a stripped down version of the `MemberVariable` with the major difference being that the string representation returns the fully qualified type instead.
The available fields are

| field       | description                                                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bare_type` | The type without the namespace                                                 |
| `namespace` | The (potentially empty) namespace                                              |
| `full_type` | The fully qualified type, corresponding to `{{ namespace }}::{{ bare_type }}`. |

### Julia code generation
It is an experimental feature.
