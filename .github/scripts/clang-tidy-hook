# Thin wrapper around clang-tidy that we need to make sure that we can pass the
# include directories for SIO to clang-tidy as it seems that it's not always
# present in the compile database that is generated by CMake. This is mainly
# necessary for template heavy header only parts that get included and for which
# clang-tidy runs into a clang-diagnostic-error because it cannot find an SIO
# header. We cannot do this in the pre-commit configuration because we cannot do
# any shell expansion there.

# Safe guard against environments where we do not have SIO available. The
# clang-tidy checks will probably fail, but at least we are not getting problems
# with passing garbage as extra arguments
