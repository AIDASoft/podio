# -- Gitlab CI configuration for podio -----------------------------
#
# This file configures the deployment of the code reference generated by sphinx
# / doxygen to a web site. The site produced in the generate-docs is static and
# relocatable, the html files can simply be hosted by any server. Here, the CERN
# gitlab and eos infrastructure is used to publish to
# https://key4hep.web.cern.ch/podio/


# -- Run Doxygen ------------------------------
# Doxygen is set up in CMake, so need to load all
# dependencies to run it. This step requires a runner
# that can build edm4hep and run doxygen. The easiest way to
# ensure this is require cvmfs access on the runner and take the
# software from there.
generate-docs:
  # need a runner with cvmfs installed. On the CERN gitlab instance,
  # these are usually tagged with "cvmfs"
  tags:
    - k8s-cvmfs

  script:
    # use a setup that provides all dependencies - if the dependencies change,
    # this needs to be updated
    - source /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh
    - export PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
    - export PYTHONPATH=/root/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

  # as an artifact

# -- Deploy to EOS ----------------------------
# Use the standard workflow to publish to eos
# see https://gitlab.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-web-deployer
# The variables for this particular deployment:
# CI_OUTPUT_DIR: doc_output
# EOS_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD: xxx
# EOS_ACCOUNT_USERNAME: xxx
# EOS_PATH: /eos/project/k/key4hep/www/key4hep/podio
# METHOD: rsync
# are set in the repository https://gitlab.cern.ch/key4hep/edm4hep,
# which mirrors https://github.com/key4hep/edm4hep
# In particular, the service account key4hep is used to write
# to the eos space /eos/project/k/key4hep/www/edm4hep
# Other accounts which are part of the e-groups
# cernbox-project-key4hep-{readers|writers} may be used.
# The eos path and website are configured using https://webeos.cern.ch/
deployment:
  # make sure that changes are deployed only when they are merged to master
  only:
    refs:
      - master
      - gitlab-doc # for testing
  # need the doxygen artifacts for this step
  dependencies:
    - generate-docs
  stage: deploy
  # see see https://gitlab.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-web-deployer
